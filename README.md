# Delia
Named after [Delia Derbyshire](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2020/10/06/delia-derbyshire-the-myths-and-legendary-tapes/) and partly inspired by an analogue synthesizer she made using four film strips as the playing interface.

This repo is an experiment to generate "illustrative visualisations" from music.
